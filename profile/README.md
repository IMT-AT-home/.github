Aligned with Mauá’s values of innovation, excellence, and social responsibility, this initiative aims to develop autonomous home solutions and compete internationally in RoboCup\@Home.

## About RoboCup\@Home

### History & Purpose

RoboCup\@Home is part of RoboCup, established in 1997 to advance robotics and AI research through sport and service competitions. The @Home league focuses on robots that assist people with everyday tasks in domestic settings, driving progress in navigation, interaction, and perception.

### Challenge Categories

* **Object Manipulation**: Picking up, transporting, and placing various objects.
* **Navigation**: Planning safe and efficient routes in dynamic environments.
* **User Interaction**: Recognizing voice commands and gestures; maintaining dialogues.
* **Service Tasks**: Assisting with activities like serving beverages, cleaning, and fetching items.
* **Adaptation**: Quickly adjusting behavior based on environmental changes.

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Robustness**: Ability to handle sensor failures and unexpected situations.
2. **Accuracy**: Precision in locating objects and executing commands.
3. **Execution Speed**: Time taken to complete assigned tasks.
4. **Usability**: Ease of interaction for human users.

## Alignment with Mauá’s Values
